# Project Standards & Best Practices

## Docs

- For any documentation we use Docosaurus in docs-site dir.

## Comments

- Write code, comments & docs, in English only, even if the user communicates in another language.

## Dependencies

- Add new dependencies only if absolutely necessary. Always ask user about adding any packages.

## Pull Requests & Commits

- Write clear, descriptive commit messages in English. Each pull request should contain only related changes and be reviewed by at least one team member.

## Sensitive Data

- Never commit secrets, passwords, or API keys to the repository. Use environment variables and `.env` files, and ensure they are listed in `.gitignore`.

## Python

- Always activate venv before run scripts!

### DRY Checklist

Before committing code, ask:
- [ ] Does similar functionality exist elsewhere?
- [ ] Can this logic be extracted to a hook?
- [ ] Can this UI be extracted to a component?
- [ ] Am I copying code from another file?
- [ ] Will this pattern be used again?

If you answer "yes" to any question, refactor before proceeding.
